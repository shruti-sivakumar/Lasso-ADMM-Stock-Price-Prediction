# Stock Price Prediction using Lasso Regression with ADMM

This project uses **Lasso Regression** with the **Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)** to predict stock prices based on historical time series data. Built using Python and implemented from scratch, the project focuses on sparse linear modeling and optimization for financial forecasting.

---

## Objective

To accurately forecast Apple's (AAPL) stock prices using Lasso regression and solve the optimization problem using ADMM, enabling both predictive performance and interpretable feature selection.

---

## Why Lasso + ADMM?

- **Lasso**: Encourages sparsity in weights, removing irrelevant features — useful in financial modeling where only a few time lags or indicators might matter.
- **ADMM**: Efficient optimization method for non-differentiable problems like L1-regularized loss. Provides fast convergence and good performance for large datasets.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Yahoo Finance (via `yfinance`)
- **Ticker**: AAPL (Apple Inc.)
- **Date Range**: 2014–2023 (10 years)
- **Attributes**: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Adjusted Close

---

## Model Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning**: Dropped nulls, sorted by time.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Lagged closing prices up to 14 days.
3. **Normalization**: Standardized input features for convergence.
4. **Lasso Regression**: Formulated as:
   $$ \min_x \frac{1}{2}\|Ax - b\|_2^2 + \lambda\|x\|_1 $$
5. **ADMM Solver**: Implemented with convergence checks using primal/dual residuals.
6. **Evaluation**: MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R² on test set.
7. **Visualization**: True vs Predicted Close Price.

## Results Summary

| Metric     | Value |
|------------|--------|
| MAE        | ~1.48  |
| RMSE       | ~1.94  |
| MAPE       | ~0.92% |
| R² Score   | ~0.97  |

> The Lasso model achieved high predictive performance and selected only a subset of lag features, validating the benefit of L1 regularization.
